# Joey's Evolving Tic-Tac-Toe Game.

The game will eventually consist:
* Player vs Player (complete)
* Player vs AI (complete)
* AI vs AI (complete)
* Marker selector now added

----------------
### Info
* The game will not start until you click on the button game modes
* ~~X's always goes first~~ you can now select your marker
* AI vs AI - The pattern will always be the same, regardless of how many times you restart. This is due to the behaviour of the minimax algorithm.
* You must select your marker and game type and hit submit before you can play
* P.S Im still a newb, so be nice on feedback :)
